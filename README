## Running a local copy
This will not talk or read from metacounting or counting 

1. Update the `releaseMode` to 'debug' in `Program.cs`
2. Install docker 
3. Run `docker build -f Dockerfile .`
4. Get the docker image id with `docker images` -- it should be the top one
5. Run 'docker run -d {docker image id acquired from 4}'
